# Healthcare Agent Orchestrator - Repository Cleanup Summary

## What's Been Done

We've reorganized the repository to improve its structure and maintainability:

### 1. Script Organization

- Consolidated all PowerShell scripts into the `scripts/` directory
- Consolidated all Bash shell scripts into the `bash/` directory
- Created a `tools/` directory for repository maintenance scripts
- Provided unified launcher scripts (`run`, `run.ps1`, `run.sh`) that work across platforms

### 2. Module Consolidation

- Consolidated all Terraform modules into the `modules/` directory:
  - Moved `ai-hub` → `modules/ai-hub`
  - Moved `ai-services` → `modules/ai-services`
  - Moved `healthcare-agent` → `modules/healthcare-agent-service`
  - Moved `core-infra` → `modules/core-infrastructure`

### 3. Backup Handling

- Created a `backups/` directory to hold copies of the original directories
- Moved `backup_scripts` → `backups/scripts`

### 4. Documentation

- Created `REPOSITORY_REPORT.md` explaining the repository organization
- Created `DIRECTORY_CONSOLIDATION.md` explaining the directory consolidation
- Updated `README.md` with more detailed information on the repository structure

### 5. Clean Interface

- Streamlined the root directory to contain only essential files
- Created a simple, unified interface for all operations through launcher scripts

## Benefits

This reorganization provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Usage**: One command (`run`) to access all functionality
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Fewer files in the root directory
4. **Logical Structure**: Clear separation of concerns with each module and script having a designated location
5. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and update code

## Next Steps

- Remove any remaining redundant directories if necessary
- Update deployment documentation to reflect the new structure
- Consider further consolidation of modules with similar functionality
