# Project Structure Updates

This repository has been reorganized with the following key structural changes:

1. Module organization:
   - Terraform modules have been moved to the `tf_modules/` directory for better organization
   - Each module is properly encapsulated with its own inputs, outputs, and documentation

2. Deployment approach:
   - Direct Terraform commands are now the primary deployment method
   - Simplified deployment process with fewer wrapper scripts

3. Documentation updates:
   - Added comprehensive troubleshooting guidance
   - Clear migration path from bicep implementation
   - Detailed module usage examples

4. Version control:
   - Enhanced .gitignore to properly exclude generated files, logs, and state
   - Better handling of configuration files

See the [deployment documentation](docs/TERRAFORM_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.
